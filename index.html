    <p>Amala food ! Amala- lump free and fluffy. Hello and happy new week people. Today it's about drumrolls....... Amala! oh
    yes how to make amala????. You know when it comes to Amala we Ibadan people don't play right? and if you didn't know,
    I'm a proud flag bearer of Ibadan. Born, bred, authentic one at that</p>
    <p>If you are not familiar with this delicacy, let me give you a brief introduction. Amala is made from yam flour (Elubo)
    and is a Nigerian Cuisine mostly eaten by the Yorubas especially the people of Oyo state. Yam flour is yam that has been
    peeled, dried and blended into flour and it's typically brownish in colour.</p>

        <h4>Get your muscles and nerves ready for a quick interval training</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil water in electric kettle and measure 4 cups into a pot</li>
        
            <li>Cover the water and let it boil till it starts making bubbles like in the picture below.</li>
                <p>Tip: Use a pot that you can hold firmly to the handle and never use a non stick pot for amala.</p>
                <p>Endeavour to always buy good yam flour from trusted source.</p>
        
            <li>Lower the heat to a bare minimum and add the yam flour into the water all at once then stir/turn with wooden spoon or
            spatula (omorogun) till it comes together but it won't be smooth at this stage. This process takes about a minute.</li>
                <p>Tip: Note that number one mistake most people make is stirring and adding yam flour little at a time. That method will
                make the amala lumpy. Put in all the yam flour first before stirring.</p>
        
            <li>Add the reserved 1 cup of water to the Amala using the wooden spoon to create well in the middle and sides (Check
            picture below) and leave the water to steam the amala for 1-2 minutes.</li>
            
            <li><a href="https://i0.wp.com/kscuisine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1064.jpg?ssl=1" target="_blank">Now stir the amala for 1-2 minutes till smooth. After this time some put it down and turn. If you are making large
            quantity you might find this helpful but with this quantity it's not necessary really but if you find it easier bring it
            down and turn.</a></li>
